      Hi, and welcome to my website! I'm a full stack developer with a passion for creativity, collaboration, and exploration.

    <p class="about--paragraph">
      I love to make things. There's just something about coming together with others to make something new that is extremely fulfilling, whether it's a new feature in an application or a new piece of music. I also really enjoy diving head first into new technologies.
    </p>
    <p class="about--paragraph">When I'm not building applications, I like to play tabletop roleplaying games, go camping, or play music.</p>
